# Create your first auto-graded Python homework with Repl.it

* Note: you need the Repl.it premium teams for education product in order to follow this tutorial.

## What is audo grading and how can it help you?
* Don't spend all of your time grading homework when robots can do it for you.
* "meta code" - code that runs other code and checks its output
* You just need to give some examples with expected output

## Understanding Repl.it templates 
* You can edit them, your students can create copies but not edit the original
* People outside your team can't see them at all

## Understanding PyTest and writing a basic autograder
* Writing a test and running pytest from the shell

## From the students' point of view
* How the students can complete homework and submit it

## Grading the homework
* Running pytest on each fork

# Part 2: Automate even more: creating a centralised grader
* Set up the flask app 
* Create a new template that can submit itself
* [Not a lot of detail here about how it works, but just how to use it]

## Pros and cons of centralised and decentralised grading
* Sometimes it's useful for the students to have access to the tests as it helps them learn
* They can also use this to 'cheat' though and get high grades without properly solving the problems [example]
* Students will always try to break systems to get free grades, so keeping them simple is often better.
