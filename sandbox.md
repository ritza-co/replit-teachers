## Grading the homework
* Running pytest on each fork

# Part 2: Automate even more: creating a centralised grader
* Set up the flask app 
* Create a new template that can submit itself
* [Not a lot of detail here about how it works, but just how to use it]

## Pros and cons of centralised and decentralised grading
* Sometimes it's useful for the students to have access to the tests as it helps them learn
* They can also use this to 'cheat' though and get high grades without properly solving the problems [example]
* Students will always try to break systems to get free grades, so keeping them simple is often better.
